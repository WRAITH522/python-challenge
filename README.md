First:

New repository created for this project called python-challenge

Cloned repository to my computer.

Inside the local git repository I have created a directory for each Python challenge. With folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and PyPoll.

Inside of each folder are the following:

A new file called main.py. The main script to run for each analysis.
A Resources folder that contains the CSV files used. Including correct csv_path
An analysis folder that contains a text file with the results from the analysis.
Pushed to GitHub.
